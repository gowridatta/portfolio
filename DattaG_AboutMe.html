                        As the youngest child in a family of engineers, my dream is to major in computer science.  I was exposed to the different branches of engineering from a very young age, finding programming and computer science to be the most intriguing. I decided to focus on becoming an engineer, focusing on math and science more than ever. As I approached the end of freshman year, I decided to further pursue my interest by applying to the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy. This is currently my second year in the Academy, and I am part of the Computer Science pathway. I am currently enrolled in the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Computer Science/Software Engineering course. Last year, I took the PLTW Principles of Engineering class which sparked my interest in other engineering disciplines. I plan to continue on the Computer Science pathway by taking the AP Computer Science Applications course offered Dublin High School next year, and later pursuing higher education in a renowned university.

                        Obtaining a career in Computer Science requires a well rounded personality and skill set. Taking the lead, and taking into consideration the opinions of all the group members are some of the roles I play in  the various group projects I have taken part in. I embody these necessary skills by directing my group towards the right direction, prompting them to voice their opinions on the task assigned to us. Another valuable skill set I possess is the ability to absorb information rapidly. Experience is vital to a career in engineering. I have engaged in various extracurricular activities that allow me to flex my engineering muscles. One such activity is the US Air Force Association's CyberPatriot Program, where I am currently competing in a nationwide cybersecurity competition. Furthermore, I have tried my luck as an entrepreneur, founding the Clay for Cancer Club, with an objective of utilizing proceeds from the sales of our creations to donate to the American Cancer Society. Last year, my club was able to donate $400 to the American Cancer Society.</p>
