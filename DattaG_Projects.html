                        The objective of this project was to use the MIT AppInventor program to create an Android App. Our project was based off of the popular game, "Flappy Bird." My role in the project was working on the "coding" part to create a fully functioning game. Challenges included the game not working properly due to variations in the size of the screen being used to play the game. The coded blocks were revised multiple times to result in the most efficient and concise code possible. Through this project, I was able to understand the basics of programming through the simple blocks and processes created through the assignment.

                        </br>
                        The objective of this project was to use the web application Scratch to create a fully functioning maze. My role in this project was creating the maze and the functionalities by using the code blocks. The maze had to function such that if the person touches the walls of the maze, the level restarts. A secret level was added as well, adding a new touch to the maze. Challenges we had included the creature traveling the maze being too big to fit, and the background being black (the color of the walls, which causes the level to restart. The maze's code and structure was revised until the entire project was free of glitches. Through this project, I was able to learn more about the basics of programming through coding blocks, including variable roles and if-statements.

                        The objective of this project was to use RobotC and Vex to build and code a machine to deliver cookies in sets of three. My role in this project was to code and create the program that would direct the sensors and motors to allow the cookie factory to function as required. Challenges we had to overcome included the code not functioning properly, and our sensors working incorrectly. The code was revised multiple times until the issue was found, and the sensors were replaced, ultimately resulting in a working product. Through this project, I was able to further augment my skills in programming, and worked with my team to create the most simple yet effective design and code for our Cookie Factory.

                        The objective of this project was to use a solar and hydrogen cell to design the most efficient vehicle possible with the given supplies. My role in the project was designing and building the prototype of the vehicle, and documenting the process as well. Challenges we had to overcome included the angle in which the solar cells faced the light, which we fixed by adding support stands enforced with tape. The project was completed as a team, and we had to work together in order to create the most efficient vehicle.
