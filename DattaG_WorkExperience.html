                <h3>Guest Speakers</h3>
                <p>Some of the most memorable guest speakers this year were Anthony Strawa and Greg Tietbohl. Anthony Strawa works at NASA, and talked about different NASA projects aimed at trying to discover extraterrestrial life. One thing that really captured my attention during the presentation was when he mentioned that the Hubble telescope uses photoelectron spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of a planet. This was extremely interesting, since I took AP Chemistry, and it opened my eyes to the applications of various subjects that I had learned, to different aspects in engineering. Another guest speaker was Greg Tietbohl. Greg spoke about various things Lawrence Livermore National Labs works on. This also interested me because I am interested in joining a research facility such as LLNL and Sandia after I graduate from college.</p>
                <h3>Field Trips</h3>
                <p>One field trip that was extremely interesting was the RiskIQ Cybersecurity field trip. During the field trip, speakers spoke about various aspects of cybersecurity, and we also did a Capture the Flag competition as well. This field trip really applied to me because I am a participant of the Air Force Association's CyberPatriot competition, a competition where we have to secure different systems such as Windows 7, 8.1, Windows Server 2012 and 2016, Ubuntu, etc. We also work on a networking quiz and packet tracer activity as well. Our team has previously participated in CTF competitions, and this field trip opened my eyes to even more opportunities in this field and was very fun and educational overall. <br> Another field trip I found interesting was the NASA field trip. The most memorable part of the field trip for me, was learning about how they were trying to extract water out of human feces. While it sounds disgusting, I found this really interesting, since it would allow for nearly zero waste on space expeditions, since the majority of waste would be reused.</p>
                <h3>Mentorship Program</h3>
                <p>Through the engineering academy, I worked with a mentor from industry once a month during my Gael period. My mentor, Jeff Fisher, works at Apple on machine learning, specifically on the self driving car at Apple. I worked with my mentor to improve my interview skills, my resume, and other aspects related to engineering. I learned a lot from this experience, and was able to gain much more knowledge regarding various different aspects of a career in software engineering.</p>
